# Tic Tac Toe
Play tic tac toe against your friend or computer! Compile and run the two player version by running `g++ ttt_2p.cpp -o ttt_2p && ./ttt_2p` in your terminal. Playing against the computer is possible by executing `g++ ttt_1p.cpp -o ttt_1p && ./ttt_1p`. 

Instruct the program where to place your token in the grid using numbers 0 to 8, arranged as follows:

```
     |     |     
  0  |  1  |  2  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  3  |  4  |  5  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  6  |  7  |  8  
     |     |   
```

Have fun!
