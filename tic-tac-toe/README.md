# Tic Tac Toe
Play tic tac toe against your friend or computer! Compile and run the programming by running `g++ ttt.cpp -o ttt && ./ttt` in your terminal. You can also specify 1 player or 2 player mode by adding `1p` or `2p` to the end of the command. 

Example (1 players): `./ttt 1p`

Instruct the program where to place your token in the grid using numbers 0 to 8, arranged as follows:

```
     |     |     
  0  |  1  |  2  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  3  |  4  |  5  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  6  |  7  |  8  
     |     |   
```

Have fun!
